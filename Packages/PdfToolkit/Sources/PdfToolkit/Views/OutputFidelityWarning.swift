/// What a tool's output will genuinely lose, detected from the loaded source file(s).
///
/// Three limits can't be engineered away, so they are disclosed instead of discovered. All were
/// confirmed empirically against a hand-authored PDF carrying a real catalog `/AcroForm`
/// (PDFKit's writer won't produce one from widget annotations, so the fixture is assembled byte by
/// byte — see `PDFFixtures.writeAcroFormPDF`):
///
/// - **A form is flattened** by the tools that re-emit each page through a `CGPDFContext`
///   (Watermark, OCR, Fill & Sign, Compress, Redact). Both the catalog `/AcroForm` AND the widget
///   annotations go: the field's *appearance* is painted into the page, so the saved copy looks and
///   prints identically, but nothing interactive remains.
/// - **A form is orphaned** by the tools that rebuild by copying pages into a fresh document
///   (Extract, Reorder, Crop, Merge, Split). The widget annotations ride along on the copied pages,
///   but the catalog `/AcroForm` that binds them into a form does not — so the fields stay visible
///   and keep their values, yet no reader treats them as a fillable form any more. This is the
///   subtler of the two, which is exactly why it needs saying.
/// - **Bookmarks are dropped** by Merge and Split. A merge concatenates outlines from many documents
///   at shifting page offsets; a split cuts one outline across several files. Both deliberately drop
///   rather than ship misdirected bookmarks (see the NOTE comments in `PDFToolkit.mergeData` /
///   `PDFToolkit.split`).
///
/// Delete and Rotate mutate the document in place and lose none of the three.
///
/// A warning is only ever built when the *loaded file actually has* the thing at risk, so it stays
/// meaningful rather than becoming permanent wallpaper. Everything else these rebuilds used to lose —
/// bookmarks outside merge/split, the document title, links — is now preserved, so it is
/// deliberately not listed here.
