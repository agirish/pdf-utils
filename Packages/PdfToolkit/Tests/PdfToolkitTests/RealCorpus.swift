/// Everything else in this suite builds its fixtures at run time out of a
/// `CGPDFContext`. That is the right default — it keeps tests self-describing and
/// lets a test state exactly the shape it needs — but it means every input the
/// suite has ever seen was written by one producer, in one style: a plain
/// cross-reference table, no object streams, no embedded font programs, no
/// catalog `/AcroForm` (PDFKit's writer will not emit one), no encryption
/// dictionary the app didn't write itself.
///
/// The corpus covers that gap with a deliberately small set of files a user could
/// plausibly drop on the app, each carrying one corner case the tools warn about
/// or have historically got wrong. They are checked in rather than generated
/// during `swift test`: CI must not depend on Chrome being installed, and a
/// fixture regenerated on every run can drift underneath the assertions. Regenerate
/// with `scripts/corpus/generate.sh`; the shapes are documented in
/// `docs/testing-corpus.md`.

/// names, card numbers, emails — is invented for the redaction tests.
